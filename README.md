# Crowdfunding_ETL

This is the repo for our Project "Crowdfunding_ETL" by Jes√∫s Viloria Paolini and Lisa Maccio Maretto.

This repo contains a folder named crowdfunding_files. Inside of it, there is a jupyter notebook file where the code was written, named "Crowdfunding_ETL_codeby_LMM_and_JVP", and "Resources" folder, which holds the Excel files used to extract the data for cleaning and tranforming pandas DataFrame into csv files that where later exported into the same "Resources" folder (contains a total of 6 files). There is also the representation of the Database that was constructed afterwards with the previously generated data as a .png file and a SQL File.
